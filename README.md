Simulates Powerball drawing

Below is a Powerball Simulator I created as a Python learning project.

The program creates a winning ticket. 
Then, after determining how many tickets the player wants it creates and checks them against the winning ticket. 
Also, it determins the prize and tracks it to let you know what you would have won. Don't spend all of your money. 
(Note: Buying more than 1 million tickets will take some time.)
